This repository is a modified version of the official DCC-EX.com release for the EX-CommandStation. It has been modified to interface with the ProMiniAir Transmitter and with external DCC sources. 

The NmraDCC library has been very slightly modified to eliminate unused variables to make Arduino IDE compilation happy (no unused variables).
